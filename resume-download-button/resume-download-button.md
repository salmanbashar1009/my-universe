I'll create a simple Flutter code snippet that creates a button to download a resume. I'll assume the resume is stored in the app's assets.Resume Download Button in FlutterClick to open codeLet me break down the key points of this code:

The ResumeDownloadButton is a widget that creates a button to download a resume.
When tapped, it loads the resume from the app's assets folder.
It saves the resume to a temporary directory on the device.
It shows a snackbar to confirm the download or show an error.
I've included comments about adding the resume to assets and necessary dependencies.

#To use this:

Add your resume (e.g., resume.pdf) to an assets folder in your project.
Update pubspec.yaml with the asset and dependencies.
Import and use the ResumeDownloadButton in your app.

The code provides a simple, straightforward way to download a resume with basic error handling and user feedback. You can further customize the button's style or download behavior as needed.
